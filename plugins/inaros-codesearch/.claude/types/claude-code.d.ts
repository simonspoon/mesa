// Written by Claude Code 2.1.266.
// Claude Code function hooks: the plugin API's TypeScript declarations.
//
// EARLY ACCESS: this surface may change between releases without notice.
// Written by `/plugin-types`; regenerate with that command after an update
// rather than editing. The version that wrote it is on the line above.
//
// What is here: the module a hooks module may import types from,
//   import type { Register, On, EngineInterface } from 'claude-code'
// (at run time the import is empty), and the globals a hooks module has:
// `h`, `Fragment`, `Box`, `Text`, `Button`, `Link`, the JSX namespace,
// and the environment's web APIs (URL, TextEncoder, AbortController,
// crypto.subtle, ...). A hooks module runs in an environment of its own:
// no DOM, no Node.
//
// Typing a plugin against it:
//   export const register: Register = (on, options) => { ... }
// or, in a .js module,
//   /** @type {import('claude-code').Register} */
//   export const register = (on, options) => { ... }
//
// A tsconfig.json (or jsconfig.json) that fits a hooks module:
//   {
//     "compilerOptions": {
//       "target": "es2023", "lib": ["es2023"], "types": [],
//       "module": "esnext", "moduleResolution": "bundler",
//       "strict": true, "noEmit": true, "skipLibCheck": true,
//       "jsx": "react", "jsxFactory": "h", "jsxFragmentFactory": "Fragment"
//     },
//     "include": [".claude/types", "hooks"]
//   }
// ".claude/types" is where /plugin-types writes; "hooks" is the plugin's
// hooks/ folder. `lib` names no DOM: the environment has none, and the
// DOM's own `Text` would shadow the element.
